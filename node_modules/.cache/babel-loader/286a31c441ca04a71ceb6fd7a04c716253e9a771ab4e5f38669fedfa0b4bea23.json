GOOEY owners may perform various activities to keep\n          GOOEYs alive, or let them die and pass on to the next realm.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">What is a GOOEY?</h3>\n        <p>\n          A GOOEY is your own living, breathing, dynamic creature NFT that lives\n          in a super cute Tamagotchi-style web 3 application. GOOEYs need your\n          love and support to thrive, divide into more GOOEYs and drop gifts\n          along the way.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Each GOOEY has it's own base traits, disposition, taxonomy and age.\n          GOOEYs can also be equipped with new unique add-ons, claimable to\n          those who keep their GOOEYs healthy and happy.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Each GOOEY and base traits were hand designed with love by Omakasea\n          Art Director Dudette.

If your GOOEY's health bar runs out, your GOOEY dies and\n          may get buried forever. This means if people don't care for their\n          GOOEY, the supply will decrease. Keep in mind, as HP decreases, it\n          becomes more difficult to care for your GOOEY.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What happens if your GOOEY's health bar goes to 0?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          When your GOOEY's health falls to 0, it becomes at risk of getting\n          buried. Anyone can call the \"bury\" function on a GOOEY that has lost\n          all of it's HP. Calling this function sends the GOOEY to the burn\n          address, decreasing it from the supply forever. You can revive your\n          GOOEY by feeding it before it gets buried to restore HP.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What happens when your GOOEY health bar is full?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Your GOOEY is healthy. It will reward you with special prizes over\n          time.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          How much ETH does it take to split your GOOEY into 2?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          The amount of ETH it takes to split your GOOEY is proportional to the\n          floor price and depends on the elastic supply of the collection. As\n          the supply grows, the ETH to mitosis increases to slow inflation. As\n          more GOOEYs get buried, the ETH to mitosis decreases to boost\n          inflation.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Certain drops produced by healthy GOOEYs that when equipped, decrease\n          the amount of the ETH needed to undergo mitosis. For example, one of\n          the more rare drops gives a 50% discount off the base cumulative cost.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What can I do with the GOOEY my GOOEY buds?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Anything you want! Your new GOOEY is an entirely separate ERC-21 token\n          which can then be sold on secondary marketplaces, given away to a\n          friend/family/community member, or kept safe in your wallet.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">How do you gain health points [HP]?</h3>\n        <p>\n          You can raise your GOOEY's health by feeding ETH to your GOOEY,\n          grooming it, or putting it to sleep.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Feed: Feed your GOOEY 1x, 5x or FEAST pert TX. FEAST calculates the\n          amount of ETH remaining that is needed to undergo mitosis and feeds\n          your GOOEY that amount.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Groom: Groom your GOOEY once per TX. Grooming increases your HP by a\n          significantly larger amount than feeding.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sleeping: Put your GOOEY to sleep once per TX. Sleeping restores 100%\n          of HP but comes with side effects. Your GOOEY remains asleep for a\n          random time (no longer than one week). While asleep, HP decreases at a\n          slower than usual rate and feeding nor grooming can be done.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What other benefits are there to keeping my GOOEY alive?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Traits: An endlessly growing collection of variable rarity, claimable,\n          unlockable traits that you can equip to your GOOEY with various\n          utilities.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Alpha: Secret in-app alpha drops [think important points from Twitter\n          Spaces, insider secrets that are too based to talk about openly,\n          access to pre-recorded content, etc.]\n        </p>\n        <p>One-of-One Art: unlock special one-of-one artworks.</p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          Where does the ETH you feed to your GOOEY go?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          The ETH you feed to your GOOEY goes back to the Omakasea development\n          team.
