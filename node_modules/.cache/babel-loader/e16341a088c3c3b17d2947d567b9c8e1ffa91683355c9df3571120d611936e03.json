If your GOOEY's health bar runs out, your GOOEY dies and\n          may get buried forever. This means if people don't care for their\n          GOOEY, the supply will decrease. Keep in mind, as HP decreases, it\n          becomes more difficult to care for your GOOEY.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What happens if your GOOEY's health bar goes to 0?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          When your GOOEY's health falls to 0, it becomes at risk of getting\n          buried. Anyone can call the \"bury\" function on a GOOEY that has lost\n          all of it's HP. Calling this function sends the GOOEY to the burn\n          address, decreasing it from the supply forever. You can revive your\n          GOOEY by feeding it before it gets buried to restore HP.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What happens when your GOOEY health bar is full?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Your GOOEY is healthy.

As\n          the supply grows, the ETH to mitosis increases to slow inflation. As\n          more GOOEYs get buried, the ETH to mitosis decreases to boost\n          inflation.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Certain drops produced by healthy GOOEYs that when equipped, decrease\n          the amount of the ETH needed to undergo mitosis. For example, one of\n          the more rare drops gives a 50% discount off the base cumulative cost.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          What can I do with the GOOEY my GOOEY buds?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Anything you want!

Sleeping restores 100%\n          of HP but comes with side effects. Your GOOEY remains asleep for a\n          random time (no longer than one week).

The Gooey Gobbler\n          can pay a fee to the contract to gobble anyone else's Gooey. When that\n          Gooey is gobbled, the gobbler receives the Gooey that they gobbled,\n          and the Gobbler role is assigned to a new random Gooey. Don't worry\n          though, as it is in life, if misfortune befalls you and your Gooey is\n          gobbled, you may find that good fortune is just around the corner.\n          This functionality has yet to go live, but we will give more specific\n          information about it when it does.\n        </p>\n      </article>\n\n      <article className=\"wrapper\">\n        <h2 className=\"fluid-type\">GobDrops</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          If you have cumulatively fed your Gooey .05 ETH, you will be eligible\n          for trait drops when they occur.

The traits included in these drops\n          are their own ERC-721 NFTs that can be traded openly, and are not\n          influenced at all if you sell your Gooey, your Gooey dies, or your\n          Gooey gets gobbled by the Gooey Gobbler.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"extra-black\">\n          Types of traits: background, weather, cushion, food, wings,\n          accessories, sidekicks, inflight.\n        </div>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          There are 3 collection supply possibilities for GobDrops\n        </h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li className=\"extra-black\">\n            Generative trait collection (animated or still image)\n          </li>\n          <li className=\"extra-black\">\n            1/1s editions: each 1/1 can have 0-1000 editions\n          </li>\n          <li className=\"extra-black\">1/1s: only one available</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3 className=\"fluid-type\">\n          There are 3 creation/distribution models for GobDrops\n        </h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li className=\"extra-black\">\n            In-house drops: Crafted solely by Dudette {`&`} core team\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"extra-black\">Artist-in-residence program: </span>\n            <p className=\"display-initial\">\n              Omakasea is holding an open call for visual artists (illustrators,\n              animators) to work with us for a period of time (ideally 2-3\n              months) to create special 1/1s editions and equippable traits for\n              the gooeys.
