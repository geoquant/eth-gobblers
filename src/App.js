            What is elastic supply?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Elastic supply refers to the combination of the novel burning
            mechanism [deflationary] and the ability to split your GOOEYs into 2
            separate GOOEYs [inflationary].
          </p>

          <p>
            The initial GOOEY supply of the ETH Gobblers collection is 2000, but
            this number increases as GOOEYs undergo mitosis and decreases when
            GOOEYs get buried. GOOEY owners may perform various activities to
            keep GOOEYs alive, or let them die and pass on to the next realm.

            What is a GOOEY?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A GOOEY is your own living, breathing, dynamic creature NFT that
            lives in a super cute Tamagotchi-style web 3 application. GOOEYs
            need your love and support to thrive, divide into more GOOEYs and
            drop gifts along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each GOOEY has it's own base traits, disposition, taxonomy and age.
            GOOEYs can also be equipped with new unique add-ons, claimable to
            those who keep their GOOEYs healthy and happy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each GOOEY and base traits were hand designed with love by Omakasea

            Caring for your GOOEY
          </h3>
          <p>
            Every GOOEY has a health bar which loses health points [HP]
            gradually over time. If your GOOEY's health bar runs out, your GOOEY
            dies and may get buried forever. This means if people don't care for
            their GOOEY, the supply will decrease. Keep in mind, as HP
            decreases, it becomes more difficult to care for your GOOEY.
          </p>

          <h3 className="fluid-type">
            What happens if your GOOEY's health bar goes to 0?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When your GOOEY's health falls to 0, it becomes at risk of getting
            buried. Anyone can call the "bury" function on a GOOEY that has lost
            all of it's HP. Calling this function sends the GOOEY to the burn
            address, decreasing it from the supply forever. You can revive your
            GOOEY by feeding it before it gets buried to restore HP.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3 className="fluid-type">
          What happens when your GOOEY health bar is full?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your GOOEY is healthy. It will reward you with special prizes over
          time.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fluid-type">
          How much ETH does it take to split your GOOEY into 2?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The amount of ETH it takes to split your GOOEY is proportional to the
          floor price and depends on the elastic supply of the collection. As
          the supply grows, the ETH to mitosis increases to slow inflation. As
          more GOOEYs get buried, the ETH to mitosis decreases to boost
          inflation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certain drops produced by healthy GOOEYs that when equipped, decrease
          the amount of the ETH needed to undergo mitosis. For example, one of
          the more rare drops gives a 50% discount off the base cumulative cost.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fluid-type">
          What can I do with the GOOEY my GOOEY buds?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Anything you want! Your new GOOEY is an entirely separate ERC-21 token
          which can then be sold on secondary marketplaces, given away to a
          friend/family/community member, or kept safe in your wallet.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fluid-type">How do you gain health points [HP]?</h3>
        <p>
          You can raise your GOOEY's health by feeding ETH to your GOOEY,
          grooming it, or putting it to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feed: Feed your GOOEY 1x, 5x or FEAST pert TX. FEAST calculates the
          amount of ETH remaining that is needed to undergo mitosis and feeds
          your GOOEY that amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groom: Groom your GOOEY once per TX. Grooming increases your HP by a
          significantly larger amount than feeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleeping: Put your GOOEY to sleep once per TX. Sleeping restores 100%
          of HP but comes with side effects. Your GOOEY remains asleep for a
          random time (no longer than one week). While asleep, HP decreases at a
          slower than usual rate and feeding nor grooming can be done.
        </p>

          Where does the ETH you feed to your GOOEY go?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The ETH you feed to your GOOEY goes back to the Omakasea development
          team. This ETH will be used for: putting food in our team's mouths,
          supporting our families, and funding development so we can continue
          making dop shit for the ecosystem [such as mglth.tv, omakasea.com, and
          etc.]. We hope that the ETH Gobblers model can be used by other
          teams/artists/developers to boost their operations.

          How can the ETH Gobblers model support artists and creators through a
          new form of gamified patronage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The ETH Gobblers model is a gamification that incentivizes holders
          [via claimable drops, community access, or whatever the creator
          decides] to deposit ETH into a contract over time. We believe that
          this is an ideal on-chain solution as an alternative to softwares such
          as Patreon, Kofi, etc. to help independent project teams get ahead.

          At all times one random Gooey is the Gooey Gobbler. The Gooey Gobbler

          Gooey is gobbled, the gobbler receives the Gooey that they gobbled,
          and the Gobbler role is assigned to a new random Gooey. Don't worry
          though, as it is in life, if misfortune befalls you and your Gooey is
          gobbled, you may find that good fortune is just around the corner.
          This functionality has yet to go live, but we will give more specific
          information about it when it does.

          are their own ERC-721 NFTs that can be traded openly, and are not

              Each Gooey was minted via an invite link which indicated whether

              the disposition of your Gooey. Naughty Gooeys have 2 face types,
              and Nice Gooeys also have 2 face types. When you perform Mitosis
              on a Gooey, the disposotion follows from the parent. As of now,
              there are no plans for functionality based on the disposition of
              Gooeys, it's just a fun trait that speaks to the character of your
              Gooey.
